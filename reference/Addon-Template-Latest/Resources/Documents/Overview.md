# Minimal

Addon example that's easy to make your own.

<img width = '300' src = '../Media/Header.webp' />


## What

This is the file configured in the `package.xml`  
manifest to be shown in the addon manager  
instead of the repository README.

## Why

Most of the information of the repository README  
isn't relevant to the users of your addon, they are  
for the most part 2 separate audiences.

Both should be served adequately and not  
overloaded with information they don't need.
