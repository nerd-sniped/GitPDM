# Performance Optimization Sprint Plan

**Goal**: Eliminate UI blocking operations and improve responsiveness by moving synchronous git operations to background workers.

**Current State**: Many git operations run synchronously on the UI thread, causing freezes during repository validation, status refresh, and branch operations.

**Target State**: All heavy operations run asynchronously via job_runner, with UI updates only when results are ready.

---

## Sprint PERF-1: Core Status Refresh (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Objective**: Move the most frequently-called blocking operations to background workers.

**Why First**: `_refresh_status_views()` is called after every document save and git operation, making it the #1 UI responsiveness issue.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Make `_refresh_status_views()` Async
**File**: `freecad_gitpdm/ui/panel.py` (line ~1831)
**Current**: Synchronously calls `status_summary()` and `status_porcelain()` on UI thread
**Change**: 
- Create background job that fetches status
- Update UI labels when job completes
- Add loading state indicator

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ Status refresh doesn't block UI
- ✓ UI shows "Refreshing..." state during load
- ✓ Auto-refresh after save still works
- ✓ No race conditions if multiple refreshes triggered

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Fixes most noticeable performance issue

---

#### 1.2 Make `_update_upstream_info()` Async
**File**: `freecad_gitpdm/ui/panel.py` (line ~1731)
**Current**: Synchronously calls `get_ahead_behind_with_upstream()` which runs `git rev-list`
**Change**:
- Move ahead/behind calculation to background job
- Update upstream labels when complete
- Cache results to avoid redundant calls

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ Ahead/Behind counters don't block UI
- ✓ Shows "calculating..." or cached value during load
- ✓ Works correctly with status refresh

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Heavy git operation on every status refresh

---

#### 1.3 Optimize `_update_button_states()` to Avoid Redundant Git Calls
**File**: `freecad_gitpdm/ui/panel.py` (line ~1900)
**Current**: Calls `has_remote()` synchronously on every button state update
**Change**:
- Use cached `_cached_has_remote` consistently
- Only refresh remote status during status refresh job
- Avoid calling git during typing/UI events

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ Button state updates are instant (<5ms)
- ✓ No git subprocess calls during typing
- ✓ Remote status stays accurate

**Impact**: **MEDIUM** - Improves responsiveness during text input

---

**Sprint PERF-1 Success Metrics**:
- Document save → status refresh perceived as instant (<100ms)

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Improves new user experience significantly

---

#### 2.2 Defer Panel Initialization Heavy Operations
**File**: `freecad_gitpdm/ui/panel.py` (`_deferred_initialization`, line ~300)
**Current**: Runs git availability check synchronously
**Change**:
- Move git check to background
- Defer repo validation to background
- Show "Loading..." state during init
- Panel becomes interactive immediately

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ Panel opens instantly (<50ms)
- ✓ Git check happens in background
- ✓ Repo validation doesn't block panel display

**Impact**: **MEDIUM** - Panel opens faster, better perceived performance

---

#### 2.3 Background Load of Saved Repo Path
**File**: `freecad_gitpdm/ui/panel.py` (`_load_saved_repo_path`)

## Architecture Guidelines for All Sprints

### Pattern to Follow (from repo_picker.py, line 193):
```python
# GOOD - Async pattern using job_runner
self._job_runner.run_callable(
    "github_list_repos",
    lambda: list_repos(client, per_page=100, max_pages=10),
    on_success=self._on_repos_loaded,
    on_error=self._on_repos_error,
)
```

### Pattern to Avoid:
```python
# BAD - Synchronous blocking call on UI thread
status = self._git_client.status_summary(repo_root)  # BLOCKS!
self._display_working_tree_status(status)
```

### Principles:
1. **Never call git client methods directly from UI event handlers**
2. **Always use job_runner for subprocess operations**
3. **Show loading state before starting async operation**
4. **Update UI in success/error callbacks**
5. **Handle race conditions (operations completing out of order)**
6. **Cache results when appropriate to avoid redundant calls**
7. **Debounce rapid operations (saves, typing)**

---

## Testing Strategy

### For Each Sprint:
1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Open panel → should be instant
   - Select repo → should not freeze
   - Save document → should not freeze
   - Click buttons → immediate feedback

2. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Measure time from user action to UI update
   - Target: <100ms for any UI interaction
   - Background operations can take longer, but shouldn't block

3. **Stress Testing**:
   - Large repos (10k+ files)
   - Slow networks (GitHub operations)
   - Rapid repeated actions (spam save)

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Concurrent operations
   - Operation failures
   - Network timeouts
   - Invalid repo states

---

## Rollout Plan

1. **Sprint PERF-1**: Most impactful, test thoroughly before proceeding
2. **Sprint PERF-2**: Builds on PERF-1 patterns
3. **Sprint PERF-3**: Independent, can overlap with PERF-2
4. **Sprint PERF-4**: Polish and optimization, can be ongoing

**Total Estimated Effort**: 7-11 days across 4 sprints

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- Main risk is race conditions with async operations
- Mitigation: Careful testing, operation queuing, state management

**User Impact**: HIGH - Significantly improved responsiveness and UX
